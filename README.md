# Dirt Bike Physics Labs

The labs are intended to be a suite of games to incrementally
teach players the the fundamentals of physics. For example, the
first lab convers position and velocity. These are the first
two building blocks for calculating motion/kinematics. One of
the goals is to provide players with enough understanding to
explain the physics behind a wheelie.

The lab games provide a controlled sandbox environment to
that afford players the abilty to play around with the
array of variables. They also, include skills tests which
provide players with an opportunity to apply their newly
acquired knowledge. If a player ever needs to review
a current or past equation, the game features notebook and
help buttons.

## Planned Topics
* Position and velocity
* Acceleration
* Mass
* Gravity and force
* Momentum
* Angular Velocity
* Angular Momentum
* Wheelie
